# Homebrew Arcade

## Purpose 
This project provides resources to anyone interested in building and maintaining public or private arcade equipment and games.
It also seeks to connect with like minded open-source projects and contributors to spread joy of DIY and indie arcade titles with broader communities, public and private.

## Background
There are decades of open work in the space of indie arcade, at-home emulation cabinets, and homebrew game development. There have also been a few attempts at creating marketplaces on public arcade hardware.
The landscape is quite dense for beginners but it's never been cheaper or easier to set up your own equipment or create your own games.
